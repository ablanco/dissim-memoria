Disaster Simulator
##################

Disaster Simulator is a multi-agent system based on JADE technology.
It simulates floods and it can be easily extended to others disasters.
It generates kml files as a result of the simulation, but it would
be easy to develop new agents to generate different output files.

**This is the Final Year Project memory, written in spanish using Latex.**
